<p>Few things are more central to children’s relationship to learning than their feelings about effort, 
	especially their judgments about how hard they should try when things get difficult. While many 
	studies suggest that the ability to persist on difficult tasks affects children’s academic achievement, 
	relatively little is known about how young children learn about when and how to deploy effort. My research 
	focuses on understanding what factors impact children’s decisions to persist in the face of challenge and 
	applications of this research to real-world learning. </p>
