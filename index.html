<p>Humans are unusual in their pursuit of long-term goals where rewards are sparse and infrequent: we build ornate temples, create environmental policies, and get PhDs. Our protracted childhood provides an extended period of time to learn the high level of skills, reasoning, and cultural knowledge necessary to reach these goals. Critical to this learning process is the ability to effectively allocate effort: knowing when to persist through challenges, but also when to give up. 
	<b>I am interested in how young children calibrate their effort.</b>

<p>My work has both basic science and translational aims. From a basic science perspective, my research looks at the fundamental representations and inferences that support complex decisions around how humans allocate effort. Practically, it points to ways in which we can intervene to improve childrenâ€™s academic and life outcomes. </p>

	<p>I study children from diverse populations, ranging in age from infancy to adolescence. I employ both observational and experimental methods, integrating behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging techniques, to gain a comprehensive and causal understanding of how children make decisions about when and how hard to try.
