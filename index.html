<p>Children’s persistence in the face of challenge is central to learning. However, relatively little is known about how children learn 
	when and how to deploy effort before they enter formal schooling, a critical timepoint for intervention. <b>My research explores the 
	various factors that impact young children’s resilience and persistence in the face of challenge, with an interest in applications 
	of this research to real-world learning.<\b> The calculations that go into decisions about how to allocate effort pose a deep question of 
	learning for cognitive science broadly – children must integrate information about themselves with the world to make on the fly 
	decisions, starting in infancy. I’m particularly driven to study this question because these decisions have real world consequences 
	for children’s lives – deciding whether or not to persist through a challenge can make or break whether you reach your goals.


	
<p>I look at this question across two time scales by exploring how the social environment 1) shapes children’s moment-to-moment approach 
	towards learning and 2) over time, affects children’s brain development, schema of the world, and capacity to learn. With the first 
	question, I look at how potentially malleable social inputs can causally impact children’s decisions to persist through challenges. 
	With the second question, I explore the neural and cognitive systems children develop in response to long-term social contexts. These 
	two approaches, one correlational and one causal, are inherently synergistic and together provide a powerful avenue for translational work. 
To answer these questions, I employ lab-based and real-world manipulations, integrating behavioral, computational and neuroimaging techniques with children ranging in age from infancy to adolescence.
