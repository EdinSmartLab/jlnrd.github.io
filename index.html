<p>My research aims to use discoveries from cognitive science and neuroscience to help children thrive personally and academically. 
  Specifically, I am interested in understanding what environmental factors support both children’s approach to learning and their 
  capacity to learn. </p>

<p>Few things are more central to children’s relationship to learning than their feelings about effort, especially their judgments about how hard they should try when things get difficult.  
 While many studies suggest that the ability to persist on difficult tasks affects children’s academic achievement, relatively little is known about how young children learn about when and 
 how to deploy effort. In work with <a href="http://eccl.mit.edu/"> Dr. Laura Schulz, I explore how young children learn from environmental variables (social, statistical, etc.) about when effort will pay off. Given that 
 effort is a limited resource, it makes sense to not try hard at everything. Our goal is to elucidate the sources of evidence children use to make inferences about when a task is worth the
 effort in order to foster effortful behavior in situations where it matters most. </p>

<p>Children’s ability to learn is rooted in their neural architecture, which is rapidly developing and changing based on early life experiences. Given that humans as a species adapt to fit 
 their environment, I study how optimal neural development may vary by environmental context. In work with  <a href="http://gablab.mit.edu/"> Dr. John Gabrielii, I look at how differential early life environments impact neural 
 structure and function, and their relation to cognition. Currently, this work focuses on elucidating the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying some children’s academic and cognitive success
 despite growing up in less advantageous environments. My hope is that a better understanding of resilience in children from diverse backgrounds will open new avenues towards building interventions
 that optimally support learning in at-risk populations. </p>
