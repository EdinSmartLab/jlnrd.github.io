<h1> Research </h1>

<p>My research aims to use discoveries from cognitive science and neuroscience to help children thrive in school and in life. 
  Specifically, I am interested in understanding what environmental factors support both children’s approach to learning and their 
  capacity to learn. </p>

	
<p>Few things are more central to children’s relationship to learning than their feelings about effort, especially their judgments about 
	how hard they should try when things get difficult. While many studies suggest that the ability to persist on difficult tasks affects
	children’s academic achievement, relatively little is known about how young children learn about when and how to deploy effort. Given 
	that effort is a limited resource, it makes sense to not try hard at everything. In work with <a href="http://eccl.mit.edu/"> Dr. Laura Schulz</a>, I explore how young 
	children learn from environmental factors (e.g., social and statistical) about when effort will pay off. Our goal is to elucidate the 
	sources of evidence children use to make inferences about when a task is worth the effort. This research may help parents and educators
	to foster effortful behavior when it matters most. </p>

	
<p>Children’s ability to learn is rooted in their neural architecture, which rapidly develops and changes with early life experience. In work with
	<a href="http://gablab.mit.edu/"> Dr. John Gabrieli</a>, I look at how differential early life environments impact neural structure, function, and cognition. Currently, this work
	focuses on elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive success in children from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. My hope is that a 
	better understanding of resilience will inform tailored interventions across diverse environments.</p>
